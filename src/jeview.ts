  return `# Jeview

An unofficial local visualizer for Jev (TypeSafe System One) at ${origin}, with a live view of every call at ${origin}/
It is a gateway, not a model. Proxy calls go to the configured System One endpoint and the response returns to the
caller. Jeview keeps calls, classifier revisions, and reviews in a local SQLite database. Discussion sends selected
turn evidence to a separate OpenRouter chat model only when someone asks from the viewer; Jev itself does not chat.

The Jev key: ${keyed ? "set." : `not set yet, so calls are refused. Set it in the viewer at ${origin}/ (the key icon, top right).`}

## Send Jev requests here

Use ${origin}/v1/systemone wherever you would use https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone: the same body
{ model, state, questions }, the same answers. No key is needed from the caller. To group requests under a project or
label, add it to the path: ${origin}/<label>/v1/systemone.

## Link a question to the answer that led to it

Every answer comes back with an event id, in "events" beside the answers: { "<question id>": "<call>:<question id>" }.
When a later request follows from one of those answers, send its event id in a header: Jeview-Trigger: <event id>.
The viewer then grows that request's questions as a branch off the answer that triggered them. Jeview drops its own
headers before calling Jev, and sends the body on exactly as it came.

## Show an option by its name, not its key

The viewer labels each answer with the option's key, such as "c14". When the criteria behind the keys are objects, a
header says which part to show instead: Jeview-Display: name, or a field per question: Jeview-Display: category=name,
kind=title. A field may be a path, such as meta.title. An option without that field keeps its key, and a header that
cannot be read is ignored: it never stops a call.

## When a call is refused

Whatever Jev answers, a refusal included, comes back as Jev sent it. Jeview's own refusals are JSON, { "error": "..." }:

- 401: no Jev key is set.
- 400: a Jeview-Trigger that is empty or longer than 200 characters.
- 413: a body over ${BODY_LIMIT / 1024 / 1024} MB.
- 502: Jev could not be reached, or its answer was cut short.
- 403: the request came from a web page on another site. Jeview serves programs on this machine, not pages elsewhere.

What Jev answered or refused is recorded, and so are the 401s and 502s. The 400s, 413s and 403s are not.

## Read what was recorded (JSON, from this machine only)

- GET ${origin}/_/api/records?since=<n>: summaries in the order calls finished, at most ${PAGE.toLocaleString("en")} at a time; "cursor" is
  the next "since", and "more" says the next page is already there. ?latest=<n> starts at the latest n calls instead.
- GET ${origin}/_/api/records?ids=<id>,<id>: the summaries of those calls, at most ${IDS_LISTED.toLocaleString("en")}.
- GET ${origin}/_/api/records/<id>: one call, the request sent to Jev and the response it returned.
- GET ${origin}/_/api/search?q=<words>: the ids of the calls whose label, trigger, request or response contains every
  word, newest first, at most 1,000.

A record's "key" is the sha256 of the exact body sent to Jev.

## Author and run a local classifier

- GET or POST ${origin}/api/agents: list agents or create one with { name, source }. Source may be Markdown, native
  JSON, or Markdown with a fenced jev-agent JSON block. Markdown outside the block becomes shared guidance.
- PUT ${origin}/api/agents/<id>/revisions with { source }: save the next active revision. Older revisions remain.
- POST ${origin}/api/agents/validate with { source }: check the typed Choice, Noul, or Score definition locally.
- GET ${origin}/api/history/sessions and GET ${origin}/api/history/turns?session=<id>: find completed local turns.
- POST ${origin}/api/jev/evaluate with { sessionId, turnIds: [oneTurnId], agentId, scope: "turn" }: evaluate one
  completed turn, including its tool events, through Jev. Use scope "messages" to omit tools.
- GET ${origin}/api/jev/results?session=<id>: retrieve pinned source revision, turn hash, response, and reviews.
- PUT ${origin}/api/jev/results/<id>/review with { questionId, correct: true|false|null }: mark an answer for review.
- GET or POST ${origin}/api/workflows: list or save an ordered workflow, or a graph of pinned agent questions,
  AND/OR/NOT gates, and one output. A saved graph is one reusable endpoint.
- POST ${origin}/api/workflows/project with { graph }: estimate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy from editable
  prevalence and per-agent assumptions. This assumes independent agent errors and does not call Jev.
- POST ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/run with { sessionId, turnId, scope: "turn" }: run the saved workflow on one turn.
  Graph agents each receive that same turn; gates combine their typed answers after Jev responds.
- PUT ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/labels with { sessionId, turnId, positive: true|false|null }: label the true outcome.
- GET ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/metrics?session=<id>: paired baseline and graph confusion counts on labeled turns.
- POST ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/replay with { sessionId, scope: "turn" }: rerun labeled turns through Jev.
- POST ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/rescore with { sessionId }: recompute gate decisions from compatible saved
  answers without another Jev call. Changed agent revisions or questions need a new Jev run.

## Route a host task to an authored tool and instruction

- POST ${origin}/api/workflows with { kind: "tool-router", name, minConfidence, routes: [{ id, label, when,
  toolId, instructionId, instruction, minConfidence? }] }: save a reusable Jev Choice router. The instruction text
  remains local; Jev sees the route description and available tool description, not the instruction body.
- GET ${origin}/api/browser/tools: list actual tools offered by the connected local Browser Harness MCP process.
- POST ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/route with { task, availableTools: [{ id, description }], preview?: true }:
  compile a request or make one Jev decision. Use { task, toolSource: "browser-harness" } to discover current browser
  tools before and after the Jev call. The result is an exact handoff or a review hold; Jeview never executes it.
- GET ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/route-runs: latest saved decisions and correctness counts for the current route
  definition. PUT ${origin}/api/workflows/<id>/route-runs/<run-id>/feedback with { correct: true|false|null, note? }:
  review one result. Edit routes and rerun a task to check a fix; old labels do not prove the changed version accurate.
